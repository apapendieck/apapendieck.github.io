## Purpose

This website is designed to present ongoing research in the Jayich lab.

## Website source code

The code to generate this website can be found here:  [jayich/blotter](https://github.com/jayich/blotter). Feel free to fork the code and develop a website for your lab. A link back from your about page would be appreciated.
