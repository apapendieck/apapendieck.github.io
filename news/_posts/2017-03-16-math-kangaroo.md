[Ania Jayich](http://www.10-9lab.com/) and I created the first [Math Kangaroo](https://www.mathkangaroo.org/mk/default.html) center in Santa Barbara, CA in late 2016.  Math Kangaroo is an international math competition that takes place annually on the third Thursday in March.  Leading up to this year's exam we hosted 5 practice sessions on Saturday mornings for the eighteen 1st through 5th graders that registered for our Math Kangaroo center.  Twelve students from our center took the 2017 Math Kangaroo exam, along with roughly 5 million students worldwide.  See me with students on test today with our new Math Kangaroo shirts.  We are looking forward to growing the program and hosting more practice sessions soon for Math Kangaroo 2018.
