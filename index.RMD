I am a learning scientist and action researcher with over 15 years of experience engaging technology for education, capacity-building and collective action. As Learning Scientist and Lecturer at UT Austin's Jackson School of Geosciences, I teach and study issues of learning, teaching, communication and the social impact of science and technology.  

My current research is focused on affect and narrative aspects of STEM identity development. I also study learning and innovation in culturally, disciplinarily and technologically diverse networks. I study EdTech service ecosystems, examining how values and ethics pattern and are patterned by technology, design and innovation processes. A recent editor of the Texas Education Review, I have reviewed for and published in a variety of scholarly journals, and have presented my work at conferences for the American Education Research Association (AERA), the International Society of the Learning Sciences (ISLS) and the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE). 

I have a PhD in Learning Technologies from the University of Texas at Austin, an MPH in International Health from Tulane University and a BA in Philosophy and Biology from Macalester College.
