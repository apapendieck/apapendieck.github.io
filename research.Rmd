## Learning in Open and Participatory Media Ecologies

Contemproray participatory media enables the fluid formation and disruption of learning networks, presenting a challenge to traditional notions of learning as a highly disciplined, community-bound activity. I use ethnographic and multimodal narrative case study approaches to study cases of participatory and connected learning, including networks of urban ed-tech innovators, student scientists undertaking course-based research, citizen scientists, and community teaching artists. This research reveals what "21st century skills" of "connected" and "lifelong" learning really look like *in the digital wild*, and informs the design of better, more relevant and equitable open learning and innovation networks.

## Values-sensitive Technology Innovation

Technology is too often presumed to be *neutral*, *good* or *inevitable*, and as such it tends to be engaged in ways that ultimately re-inforce the educational and social orthodoxy.  I study how innvoative teachers and technology entrepreneurs engage position themselves with respect to the educational status quo in order to expand our understanding of *what counts* as innovative in education, and *who counts* as an innovator. By more consistently surfacing the values and ethical implications of technology engagment in educational contexts, I hope to identify and support the kind of *critical innvoations* and *critical innovators* that stand a chance of "disrupting" entrenched notions of what school is, could, and should be.

## Design Research on Global and Distance Education

I create experiences that engage learners in activities and environments that reflect the cultural and infrastructural contexts in which they aspire to act, and that show them what it means to innovate through their activity. I have designed, taught in and taught about online learning experiences and digital infrastructure for global education, development, and health, for over 15 years.  I am particularly interested in the design of international distance education activities that carefully link global goals and resources with local communities and priorities.  I have evaluated and disseminated findings on distance and online programs as cases of blended instruction, digital assessment, and alternative credentialing for professional development, training and higher education in university, NGO and grassroots organizational contexts.
